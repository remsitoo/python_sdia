# Lab4 

## Objectives 

Standard techniques and libraries to accelerate numpy codes (cython, numba). 
The implementation will be compared and validated against the corresponding scikit-learn implementation.

## Assessment 

This lab session will be evaluated, based on your answer to the exercises reported in the Jupyter notebook.\
Any code produced should be commented whenever appropriate, custom functions and objects documented and unit-tested (see Lab1).\
Figures produced should be clearly annotated (axis, title, legend whenever appropriate).

Your aswers will be evaluated depending on:
1. Numerical correctness
2. Implementation clarity (documentation, relevance of the comments)
3. Answers to the questions and overall presentation of the Jupyter notebook.

## Submission Guidelines

You will have to submit a .zip file named LAST_NAME1-LAST_NAME2-Lab4.zip with your solutions.

The deadline is indicated on Moodle. Please upload your zip file before then.

## Late Policy

Each day delay will result in -2 points (the labs are scored out of 20).
